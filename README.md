# simplesitegenerator
A simple site generator in C. Well... if I have the mojo to get it working that is.

## Status

Currently abandoned. I learned a lot about C in this project and lexical
parsing but I need to keep the end product in mind and choose a framework
that makes sense for the tool I am choosing. 

I will revist this project if a particular sub-module of the code I produce
would benefit from a more performant code system.
